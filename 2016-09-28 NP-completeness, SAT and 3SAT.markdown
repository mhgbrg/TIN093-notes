# NP-completeness, SAT and 3SAT

A problem is called *NP-complete* if it is in NP, and every problem in NP is reducible to it.

There is no NP-complete problem in P (unless P=NP).

## SAT

*Boolean satisfiability problem*.

* **Boolean variables**: `xi`
* **Literals**: Variables or negated variables.
* **Clause**: Literals connected by `or`.
* **Conjunctive normal form (CNF)**: Clauses connected by `and`.
